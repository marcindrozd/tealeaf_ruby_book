# 1. Use the each method of Array to iterate over 
# [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], and print out each value.

my_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

my_array.each { |value| puts value }

# 2. Same as above, but only print out values greater than 5.

my_array.each { |value| puts value if value > 5 }

# 3. Now, using the same array from #2, 
# use the select method to extract all odd numbers into a new array.

new_array = my_array.select { |value| value if value % 2 != 0 }
p new_array

# 4. Append "11" to the end of the original array. Prepend "0" to the beginning.

my_array.push(11)
my_array.unshift(0)

p my_array

# 5. Get rid of "11". And append a "3".

my_array.pop
my_array << 3

p my_array

# 6. Get rid of duplicates without specifically removing any one value.

my_array.uniq!

p my_array

# 7. What's the major difference between an Array and a Hash?
# Answer: Array is an ordered list of items, hash is a collection of values,
# where each value corresponds to a key.

# 8. Create a Hash using both Ruby syntax styles.

my_hash1 = {:name => "Bob"}
my_hash2 = {name: "Bob"}

# 9. Suppose you have a hash 

h = {a:1, b:2, c:3, d:4}

# a. Get the value of key `:b`.

p h[:b]

# b. Add to this hash the key:value pair `{e:5}`

h[:e] = 5
p h

# c. Remove all key:value pairs whose value is less than 3.5

h.delete_if { |k, v| v < 3.5 }
p h

# 10. Can hash values be arrays? 
# Can you have an array of hashes? (give examples)

my_hash = { a: [1, 2, 3] }
p my_hash

array_of_hashes = [ { a: 1 }, { b: 2 }]
p array_of_hashes

# 11. Look at several Rails/Ruby 
# online API sources and say which one you like best and why.

# 12. Given the following data structures. 
# Write a program that moves the information from the array into 
# the empty hash that applies to the correct person.

contact_data = [["joe@email.com", "123 Main st.", "555-123-4567"],
            ["sally@email.com", "404 Not Found Dr.", "123-234-3454"]]

contacts = {"Joe Smith" => {}, "Sally Johnson" => {}}

contacts["Joe Smith"][:email] = contact_data[0][0]
contacts["Joe Smith"][:address] = contact_data[0][1]
contacts["Joe Smith"][:phone] = contact_data[0][2]
contacts["Sally Johnson"][:email] = contact_data[1][0]
contacts["Sally Johnson"][:address] = contact_data[1][1]
contacts["Sally Johnson"][:phone] = contact_data[1][2]

p contacts

# Using the hash you created from the previous exercise, 
# demonstrate how you would access Joe's email and Sally's phone number?

puts contacts["Joe Smith"][:email]
puts contacts["Sally Johnson"][:phone]

# In exercise 12, we manually set the contacts hash values one by one. 
# Now, programmatically loop or iterate over the contacts hash 
# from exercise 12, and populate the associated data from 
# the contact_data array. 
# Hint: you will probably need to iterate over 
# ([:email, :address, :phone]), and some helpful methods might be 
# the Array shift and first methods.

# Note that this exercise is only concerned with dealing with 1 entry 
# in the contacts hash, like this:

contact_data = ["joe@email.com", "123 Main st.", "555-123-4567"]
contacts = {"Joe Smith" => {}}

keys = [:email, :address, :phone]

contact_data.each_with_index do |value, index| 
  contacts["Joe Smith"][keys[index]] = contact_data[index]
end

p contacts

# As a bonus, see if you can figure out how to make it work with 
# multiple entries in the contacts hash.

contact_data = [["joe@email.com", "123 Main st.", "555-123-4567"],
            ["sally@email.com", "404 Not Found Dr.", "123-234-3454"]]

contacts = {"Joe Smith" => {}, "Sally Johnson" => {}}

keys = [:email, :address, :phone]

contact_data.each_with_index do |first_value, first_index|
  first_value.each_with_index do |second_value, second_index|
    puts contacts[contacts.keys[first_index]][keys[second_index]] = contact_data[first_index][second_index]
  end
end

p contacts

# 15. Use Ruby's Array method delete_if and String method start_with? 
# to delete all of the words that begin with an "s" in the following array.

arr = ['snow', 'winter', 'ice', 'slippery', 'salted roads', 'white trees']

arr.delete_if { |word| word if word.start_with?("s") }
p arr

# Then recreate the arr and get rid of all of the words that start 
# with "s" or starts with "w".

arr = ['snow', 'winter', 'ice', 'slippery', 'salted roads', 'white trees']

arr.delete_if { |word| word if word.start_with?("s") || word.start_with?("w") }
p arr

# 16. Take the following array:

a = ['white snow', 'winter wonderland', 'melting ice',
    'slippery sidewalk', 'salted roads', 'white trees']

# and turn it into a new array that consists of strings containing one word. 
# (ex. ["white snow", etc...] â†’ ["white", "snow", etc...]. 
# Look into using Array's map and flatten methods, as well as 
# String's split method.

new_array = a.map { |word| word.split }
p new_array.flatten!

# 17. What will the following program output?

hash1 = {shoes: "nike", "hat" => "adidas", :hoodie => true}
hash2 = {"hat" => "adidas", :shoes => "nike", hoodie: true}

if hash1 == hash2
  puts "These hashes are the same!"
else
  puts "These hashes are not the same!"
end

# Answer: "These hashes are the same!"
